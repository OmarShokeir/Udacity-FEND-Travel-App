# Udacity FEND Travel App

This project is the last project of Udacity FEND Nanodegree (Capstone).
- It is basically a web app that takes from a user as an input a Zip or a Postal code & using **GeoNames API**, it generates the coordinates.
- Coordinates is then fed into the **Weatherbit API** and it returns the current or predicted forecast depending on the date of the trip.
- **Pixabay API** is used to generate display an image of the destination.

# Used APIs:

- Weatherbit API: For weather data.
- Geonames API: Gives us the coordinates from the Zip code.
- Pixabay API: Display image of the location entered.

# Elective used:

- REST Countries List API used to fill countries list for the user automatically.
